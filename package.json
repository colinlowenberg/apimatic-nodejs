  "description": "The Disgo API is a modern HTTP interface that follows the REST architecture with a JSON format. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. [JSON](http://www.json.org) is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.  ### HTTP Responses Disgo uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Response codes in the 200-299 range indicate success, codes in the 400-499 range indicate an error that failed given the information provided, and codes in the 500-599 range indicate an error with the Dispatch node. When a request is valid but does not complete successfully, we return a 402 error code.  #### Status and Error Codes | Status Code.          | Summary                         |  | ---------------------------- |:-------------------------------:|  | 200 - OK                |Everything worked as expected. | | 400 - Bad Request       |The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. | | 401 - Unauthorized      |No valid API key provided. | | 402 - Request Failed    |The parameters were valid but the request failed. | | 404 - Not Found         |The requested resource doesn't exist. | | 405 - Method Not Allowed         |The requested resource doesn't exist. | | 409 - Conflict         |The request conflicts with another request  | | 418 - I'm a teapot         |The node is not a delegate. Please use a delegate when making this request.  | | 429 - Too Many Requests |Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. | | 500, 502, 503, 504 -    |Server Errors Something went wrong on Disgo's end. (These are rare.) | ",
